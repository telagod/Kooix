# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Aster is currently in MVP stage. Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis to the latest `main` branch.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main`  | ✅ |
| Others  | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately by contacting the maintainer via GitHub security advisory flow (preferred):

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Security** → **Advisories**.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
4. Include impact, reproduction steps, affected files/paths, and suggested remediation if available.

If advisory flow is unavailable, open a private communication channel with the maintainer and include the same information.

## What to Include

- Vulnerability type and impact
- Reproduction steps / PoC
- Affected commit/version
- Suggested fix or mitigation
- Any known exploit preconditions

## Response Targets (Best Effort)

- Initial triage response: within 72 hours
- Confirmation and severity assessment: within 7 days
- Patch target: as soon as practical based on risk and complexity

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure.
- Please allow time for validation and patching before public disclosure.
- Once fixed, we may publish a summary and remediation notes.
